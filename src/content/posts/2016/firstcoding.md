# First Coding Documentation

My first coding experience was both exciting and confusing.

I typed my first lines of code and saw something happen on the screen.

It felt like magic, even I didn't no what actually happening and absolutely I don't understand.

Errors everywhere, until I know that HTML is not a programming language.

**HTML IS MARKUP LANGUAGE**

But that made me want to learn more about it.

So, here my first personal website with little touch of **CSS**. Yohohoho.
